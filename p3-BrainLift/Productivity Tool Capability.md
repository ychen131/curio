I want a productivity tool to help me with the following:
1.  Be able to automatically create [[Categorization]] for each new content I input. (eg. Swift --> programming language, Obsidian --> tool) 
2.  Be able to set [[Priority]] for new content I should spend time learning based on my project and personal goals for a given amount of time (eg.week, month, quarter )
3. Be able to return [[Learning Content]] to help me learn the new content, the amount of coaching depends on my [[Priority]]  (i.e a learning plan of some sort)
4. Be able to [[Reminder]] of my learning journey and send me [[reminder]] if I am falling behind
5. Be able to [[Test My Knowledge]] on a timely basis, eg. flash card
6. Be able to [[analysis learning pattern]] and create more personalized learning experience for me
7. Be able to [[pep talk]] me when I am falling behind and need some help getting back on track, even tailor the learning for the user
