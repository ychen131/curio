After creating [[Problem Statement]], I also want to think about learning goals I want to achieve through the Gauntlet experience and build better better habit in learning new content in general.

##### Goal 1: have a good understanding of what each of the [[framework]], [[programming language]] / [[tools]] does.

- Measure: be able to give a summary in a few sentence

##### Goal 2: be able to apply new knowledge to existing or upcoming projects.

- Measure: usage in a project and be able to articulate how it is used

I can definitely use a [[Productivity Tool Capability]] to help me achieve these goals.

##### Post-project Goal: evolve this tool into helping users quickly become expert in an unfamiliar industry.
